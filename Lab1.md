6. Create a pull request from new new branch into master, and request a code review.

## The tibbles chapter, 7

1. Create a small tibble manually
2. Do exercises 1,2,4,5,6 from this chapter.  I have no idea what 3 is about, so it can't be important, right???


## The readr chapter, 8

In the first set of chapter questions, do questions 1, 2, and 4.

If you have time, do 5.


## The tidy chapter, 9

Note: there is an annoyance in this chapter.  The data sets, table1, etc., may have to be referred to as tidyr::table1.

Do the following:

1. Exercise 3 in the first set of exercises.
2. Exercise 2 in the second set of exercises

## The "database-like stuff" with dplyr chapter, 10

1. Exercise 1 in first set of exercises
2. Exercise 2 in the second set of exercises

Note: this chapter is worth studying in detail!!  Join operations are extremely common.  We just don't have time to have
you do all the problems.

## Dplyr and databases
